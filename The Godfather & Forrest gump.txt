FADE IN:

EXT. CORLEONE FAMILY COMPOUND - DAY

The Corleone family compound is abuzz with activity. Men in suits and fedoras mill about, speaking in hushed tones. Suddenly, a car pulls up and out steps FORREST GUMP.

FORREST
(to himself)
Wow, this is some fancy place.

As Forrest makes his way towards the front entrance, he is stopped by a stern-looking man.

MAN
What do you want here?

FORREST
I'm here to see the Godfather.

The man eyes Forrest suspiciously, but eventually relents and leads him inside.

INT. CORLEONE FAMILY COMPOUND - DAY

Forrest is brought before DON VITO CORLEONE, who is sitting behind his desk.

VITO
So, you want to do business with me?

FORREST
Yes, sir. I have a proposition for you.

VITO
(skeptical)
Go on.

Forrest takes a deep breath and launches into his pitch.

FORREST
You see, I've come up with a new kind of shrimp. It's called "Bubba Gump Shrimp," and it's the best dang shrimp you'll ever taste.

Vito looks amused by Forrest's enthusiasm.

VITO
(smiling)
And what do you want from me, Mr. Gump?

FORREST
I want you to invest in my company. With your help, we can make Bubba Gump Shrimp the biggest shrimp company in the world.

Vito leans back in his chair, considering Forrest's proposal.

VITO
(laughing)
You remind me of my son Michael. He's always been a dreamer, just like you.

Forrest smiles at the comparison.

VITO (CONT'D)
But I'm afraid I cannot help you. My business interests are elsewhere.

Forrest looks disappointed but not defeated.

FORREST
That's okay, sir. I understand. Thank you for your time.

Vito nods, and Forrest turns to leave.

EXT. CORLEONE FAMILY COMPOUND - DAY

As Forrest exits the compound, he is met by one of Vito's men.

MAN
Mr. Gump, the Don would like to see you again.

Forrest is surprised but follows the man back inside.

INT. CORLEONE FAMILY COMPOUND - DAY

Forrest is brought back into Vito's office.

VITO
Mr. Gump, I've been thinking about your proposal. And while I cannot invest in your company, I may be able to offer you something else.

Forrest looks hopeful.

VITO (CONT'D)
I have a job for you. You see, there is a man who has been causing me and my family some trouble. I need you to take care of him.

Forrest looks unsure.

FORREST
I don't know if I can do that, sir.

Vito leans forward, his eyes piercing.

VITO
If you do this for me, I will make sure that your shrimp company is protected from any unwanted interference. You have my word.

Forrest considers this for a moment before nodding.

FORREST
Alright. What do I have to do?

Vito hands Forrest a gun.

VITO
(track)
You know what to do.

Forrest takes the gun and exits the office.

EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - DAY

Forrest walks down a crowded street, looking for his target. Finally, he spots him across the street. It is DERRICK THE BRITTLE, leader of the Old Head Axe gang.

Forrest takes a deep breath and





slowly begins to cross the street. As he gets closer to Derrick, he can hear the man muttering to himself, clearly drunk.

DERRICK
(slurring)
Who the hell are you?

Forrest stops in front of Derrick and aims the gun at him.

FORREST
I'm Forrest Gump. And I've been sent here to take care of you.

Derrick looks confused for a moment before he realizes what's happening.

DERRICK
(angry)
You think you can just waltz in here and take me out? You're in for a big surprise, buddy.

Derrick reaches for a hidden weapon, but Forrest is too quick. He pulls the trigger and Derrick falls to the ground, dead.

Forrest takes a deep breath and looks around. He knows that his life will never be the same again, but he also knows that he made the right decision.

INT. CORLEONE FAMILY COMPOUND - DAY

Forrest returns to the Corleone family compound, where he is greeted by Don Vito.

VITO
Well done, Mr. Gump. You have done me a great service.

Forrest hands the gun back to Vito, feeling relieved.

FORREST
Thank you, sir. I'm glad I could help.

VITO
And as for your shrimp company, I will make sure that it is protected. You have my word.

Forrest nods, feeling grateful.

FORREST
Thank you, sir. I won't forget this.

Vito smiles and nods, dismissing Forrest.

EXT. NEW YORK CITY - DAY

Forrest exits the Corleone family compound and walks down the street. As he looks around at the busy city, he can't help but feel a sense of awe at the power that he has just witnessed.

FORREST (V.O.)
Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get. But sometimes, you have to take risks in order to succeed. And sometimes, those risks can lead to unexpected places.

Forrest looks up at the sky, feeling hopeful.

FORREST (V.O.)
But no matter what, I know that I will always be true to myself. And that's something that no one can take away from me.

The camera pulls back as Forrest walks down the street, his future uncertain but full of possibilities.

EPILOGUE

Years later, Forrest Gump had retired from his shrimp business and settled down in a small town in Alabama. He spent his days fishing and enjoying the simple life, but he never forgot his time with the Corleone family.

One day, he received a letter in the mail from Michael Corleone, the new Don of the family. Michael thanked Forrest for his service and informed him that the shrimp company was still being protected by the family, even though Forrest had long since retired.

Forrest smiled as he read the letter, feeling proud of the legacy he had left behind. He knew that his time with the Corleones had changed his life in ways he could never have imagined, but he was grateful for the experience.

FORREST (V.O.)
Sometimes, the most unexpected paths can lead to the greatest adventures. And sometimes, those adventures can change us in ways we never thought possible. But no matter where life takes us, it's important to always remember who we are and where we come from.

Forrest looked out at the serene lake in front of him, feeling content. He knew that his story was far from over, but he was ready for whatever came next.

FADE TO BLACK.

THE END.
