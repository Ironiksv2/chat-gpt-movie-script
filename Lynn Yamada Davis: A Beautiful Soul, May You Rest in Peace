You probably knew her as the fun-loving cooking Grandma, but I'll always remember her as the woman who fought off her cancer diagnosis for as long as she could, humbly and quietly, without ever complaining, until it got the best of her, I can't stop crying right now. I wish you guys could've gotten to know her in person like I did. Rest in peace, Lynja."

- TheAliKoca:"The world lost a great person yesterday. If you have an internet connection, there's a very heavy chance you've seen her face at some point. I'm talking about Lynja, the 67-year-old cooking sensation. Millions of people made her a part of their daily life and learned about cooking from her. She always focused on the positives of life and had a radiating passion for food, which was evident in every single piece of content that she posted. She's a huge inspiration because she was 63 when she started to make videos and she amassed more than 30 million followers across all platforms in the last 4 years. Most people would have retired, but she changed the world in her Golden Years. Even with all that, she still said her favorite part about her new job was being able to make videos together with her family. Success was by no means a stranger to her; she went to MIT and was an engineer for 30 years beforehand. And now, even though she is no longer with us, she will never be forgotten. Rest in peace to the internet's favorite grandma. She lived her life to the fullest, and the rest of us can hope to have a life like hers."
